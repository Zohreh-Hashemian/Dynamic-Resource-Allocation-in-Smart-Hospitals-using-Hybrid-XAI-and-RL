# Dynamic Resource Allocation in Smart Hospitals using Hybrid XAI + RL
A dynamic resource allocation system for smart hospitals using Hybrid XAI and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This system optimizes resource distribution (e.g., ICU beds, ventilators, staff) while ensuring transparency and fairness through explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME.
